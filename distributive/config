-- This provides a custom ~/.cabal/config file for use when hackage is down that should work on unix
--
-- This is particularly useful for travis-ci to get it to stop complaining
-- about a broken build when everything is still correct on our end.
--
-- This uses Luite Stegeman's mirror of hackage provided by his 'hdiff' site instead
--
-- To enable this, uncomment the before_script in .travis.yml
